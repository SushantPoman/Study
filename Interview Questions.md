14. transient
15. @EnableAutoConfigurations
16. restcontroller vs controller, when to use what
17. how to configure one to many mapping
18. what is optional @Pathvariable or @RequestParam and @QueryParam
19. why to use @ResponseBody
20. idempotent operation
21. how to get 100 properties in service layer(@ConfigurationProperties)
22. Types of autowiring
23. Diff between contructor injection and setter injection
24. unit testing - write junit
25. Event based architecture
26. Stubbing in testing
27. Scopes (Singleton, prototype, session, request, application)
28. Pessimistic Locking vs Optimistic Locking in JPA
29. How do you secure your APIs?
30. Can we use object as a key in HashMap in Java? If Yes then How can you implement that?
31. Let’s say you want to make parallel call for the services, how can you do that using Java ?
32. How will you handle Multiple microservice instances with the same service?
33. How will I write the code using Hibernate? what will be the steps in my DAO classes and it’s implementation class?
34. You can 3 instances for one service, how will you ensure that all the request are not going to one service only - Finnclient vs RestTemplate
35. Change management endpoints - actuator endpoint should be different from system endpoint
36. Security, load balancing and scaling
37. Design patterns - Singleton, Factory, Abstract Facotry, Facade, Decorator, Adapter, Strategy and Front controller

39. Instagram like functionality
40. Storing artifacts jar
41. How will you ensure that your application is available to all the consumers (Alert related to high traffic)
42. Interchange the annotations(@Service, @Repository or @Controller) what will happen, will it give compile or runtime error or it will work fine?
43. Consumed API AWS can not accept more than 25 request per second, but our app can accept 2K. How can we handle it. Any setting to restrict number of calls?
44. We have two databases mysql and postgresql. Mysql is for daily use and Postgresql will require after 2 weeks. We want this on demand basis, how can we do it?
45. Domain driven design pattern


# Database
1. how to increase performance of queries
2. what is indexing
