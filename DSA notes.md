## Data Structure :
- A way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
- Data structures define the layout of data in memory and help improve the performance of operations like searching, sorting, and inserting.
- Example: Array, Linked List, Trees, Graph

### Algorithm:
- A finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms are focused on optimizing time and space.
- Example: Searching, Sorting
- Why DSA:
    - Optimization
    - Coding Interviews 
    - Real-world Applications

### About Complexities:
- DSA the main goal is to solve problems effectively and efficiently.
- To determine the efficiency of a program, we look at two types of complexities:
    - Time Complexity: This tells us how much time our code takes to run.
    - Space Complexity: This tells us how much memory our code uses.

### Asymptotic Notation
- We use asymptotic notation to compare the efficiencies of algorithms.
- It’s a mathematical tool that estimates time based on input size without running the code.
- Its focus is on how many basic operations the program performs, giving us an idea of how the algorithm behaves as input size increases.

#### Types of Asymptotic Notations:
- Big O (O): Describes the worst-case scenario or the upper bound of how the algorithm performs as the input size increases.
- Omega (Ω): Describes the best-case scenario or the lower bound.
- Theta (Θ): Describes the average-case or how the algorithm performs generally as input grows.

We are interested in the rate of growth over time with respect to the inputs taken during the program execution.

### Complexities:
- O(1)- Constant Time
    - No matter the size of the array, accessing any element takes a constant time (1 step).
    - Example: Accessing a specific element in an array by index.
    - Code Example (Array Access):

            int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            int element = arr[2]; // Accessing the 3rd element
    - Explanation: No matter how large the array is, accessing any element by its index will always take the same constant time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(1).
- O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
    - The algorithm cuts the problem size in half with each step, so the time grows logarithmically.
    - Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
    - Code Example (Binary Search):

            int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
                int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
                while (left <= right) {
                    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                    if (arr[mid] == target) {
                        return mid;
                    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                        left = mid + 1;
                    } else {
                        right = mid - 1;
                    }
                }
                return -1;
            }
    - Explanation: Binary search divides the input size in half after each comparison. Therefore if the input size doubles, the number of comparisons only increases by one. For example, in an array of size 1000, binary search only needs about 10 comparisons, which is logarithmic growth. Hence, the complexity is O(log n).
- O(n) – Linear Time
    - The time grows directly proportional to the size of the input.
    - Example: Traversing an array of size, Linear Search, Single loops
    - Code Example (Linear Search):

            int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
                for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                    if (arr[i] == target) {
                        return i; // Found the target
                    }
                }
                return -1; // Target not found
            }
    - Explanation: The algorithm goes through each element one by one, so the number of steps grows directly in proportion to the input size. If there are 10 elements, it checks 10 times. If there are 1000 elements, it checks 1000 times, hence O(n).
- O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time
    - The algorithm divides the input into subproblems (logarithmic) and processes each subproblem linearly
    - Example: Merge Sort or Quick Sort in average cases.
    - Code Example (Merge Sort):

            void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
                if (left < right) {
                    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
                    mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
                    mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);
                    merge(arr, left, mid, right); // Merge the two halves
                }
            }
    - Explanation: Merge Sort splits the array in half recursively and then merges the sorted halves. The splitting takes log n time (because the array is divided in half repeatedly), and merging takes n time at each level. This results in O(n log n) time complexity, which is much faster than O(n²) for larger inputs.
- O(n²) – Quadratic Time
    - As the input grows, the time taken increases quadratically.
    - Example: Bubble sort or checking all pairs in an array, Selection Sort
    - Code Example (Bubble Sort):

            void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
                for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
                        if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                            // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                            int temp = arr[j];
                            arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                            arr[j+1] = temp;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    - Explanation: In Bubble Sort, the outer loop runs n times and the inner loop also runs n times for each pass. This results in n * n = n² steps, so the time complexity is O(n²). For a small number of elements, this may not be a problem, but as the input grows, the time taken increases significantly.
- O(2^n) — Exponential Time Complexity
    - The time grows exponentially with the size of the input, meaning it doubles with each additional input.
    - Recursive algorithms that solve a problem by breaking it into multiple smaller subproblems, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers using recursion.
    - Code Example (Naive Recursive Fibonacci):

            int fibonacci(int n) {
                if (n <= 1) {
                    return n;
                }
                return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
            }
    - Explanation: In this recursive Fibonacci function, each call to fibonacci(n) results in two further calls to fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2) . As n increases, the number of recursive calls grows exponentially, resulting in O(2^n) time complexity. This becomes impractical for even moderate values of n .
- O(n!) - Factorial Time Complexity
    - Factorial time complexity occurs in algorithms that involve generating all possible permutations of a set, such as the brute-force solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
    - Example: Generating all permutations, TSP
    - Code Example (Permutations):

            void permute(char[] arr, int l, int r) {
                if (l == r) {
                    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
                } else {
                    for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
                        swap(arr, l, i);
                        permute(arr, l+1, r);
                        swap(arr, l, i); // Backtrack
                    }
                }
            }
    - Explanation: In this algorithm, each element has n! possible permutations, meaning the number of possible solutions grows factorially as the input size increases. For an input of size n , the algorithm has O(n!) time complexity, which is extremely inefficient for large inputs.
- Execution order:  
        O(1) < O(log log n) < O(log n) < O(√log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(n^k) < O(2^n)
        
    - Constant time O(1): Fastest, does not depend on n.
    - Double logarithmic O(log log n): Grows slower than O(log n).
    - Logarithmic O(log n): Common in binary search.
    - Square root log O(√log n): Slightly larger than O(log n).
    - Linear O(n): Direct proportional growth.
    - Linearithmic O(n log n): Used in efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort).
    - Quadratic O(n²): Nested loops, common in brute-force algorithms.
    - Cubic O(n³): More nested iterations.
    - Polynomial O(n^k): Growth based on k, where k > 3.
    - Exponential O(2^n): Very fast-growing, common in brute-force recursion.
- Summary:

### How to find complexity:

- Step 1: Identify the loops or recursive calls in your algorithm.
    - If the algorithm has a single loop that runs n times, the time complexity is O(n).
    - If there is a nested loop, the time complexity could be O(n²), O(n * m), or higher. 
- Step 2: For each operation, figure out how many times it runs as the input grows.
    - Constant time operations (like simple arithmetic) are O(1).
    - Recursive algorithms may have more complex time complexities that depend on the depth of recursion.
- Step 3: Drop constants and non-dominant terms.
    - If you have O(n + 100), it's simply O(n) because constants don't matter in Big O notation.
    - For example, O(n2 + n) is simplified to O(n2) because the quadratic term dominates.
    
## ADT and Array

### Abstract Data Type (ADT):
Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a model for a data structure that defines the behavior
of the data type without specifying its implementation. It focuses on what
operations a data type can perform rather than how it performs those operations.

#### Key Features of ADT:
1. Encapsulation of Data and Operations:
ADTs hide the internal representation of data. Users interact with the data
only through a set of well-defined operations, which ensures that the data
is safe from unintended interference.
2. Separation of Interface and Implementation:
The ADT defines an interface (a set of operations), but how those
operations are implemented is not exposed. This allows for flexibility in
implementation.
3. Reusability:
Since the implementation is hidden, ADTs can be easily reused or changed
without affecting the rest of the code that relies on them.

#### Example of ADT: Stack
A stack is a classic example of an ADT that operates on the Last In, First Out
(LIFO) principle.
1. Operations:
    - push(item) : Add an item to the top of the stack.
    - pop() : Remove and return the item from the top of the stack.
    - peek() : Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
    - isEmpty() : Check if the stack is empty.
    - size() : Return the number of items in the stack.
2. Implementation:
    The implementation can vary: a stack can be implemented using arrays,
linked lists, or any other data structure, but this is hidden from the user.
- Example Code (Java - Take it as only example of ADT with Stack):
    - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/2_array/ArrayStack.java
    
## Array:
An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays are one of the simplest data structures and are widely used because of their efficiency in accessing elements.
    
#### Key Features of Arrays:
1. Fixed Size:
The size of an array is determined at the time of creation and cannot be
changed. This is known as a static data structure.
2. Homogeneous Elements:
All elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers,
all strings).
3. Index-Based Access:
Each element in an array can be directly accessed using its index. The
index starts from 0 (first element) to n-1 (last element), where n is the
size of the array.
    
#### Array Operations:
1. Access (Retrieve/Read):
    - You can directly access any element using its index.
    - Example: arr[2] retrieves the element at index 2.
2. Insert (Add):
    - Insert a value at a specific index (if the array has space available).
    - Example: arr[0] = 10;
3. Update (Modify):
    - Change the value at a specific index.
    - Example: arr[2] = 15;
4. Delete:
    - Removing elements is not straightforward since arrays have a fixed size. You can set the element to null or 0 .
    - Example: arr[3] = 0;
5. Traverse:
    - Iterate over all elements in the array using a loop.
    - Example:

            for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(arr[i]);
            }

#### Example Code (Java):    
- https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/2_array/ArrayOperations.java

#### Relationship Between ADT and Array
1. ADT Perspective:
    - When we think of arrays as an ADT, we focus on the operations (e.g.,
insert, update, retrieve) that we can perform on the array. The actual
implementation (how the elements are stored in memory) is hidden.
2. Implementation Perspective:
    - In programming, arrays are implemented at a low level where each
element is stored in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient
access using the index.
3. Example: 
    - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/2_array/ArrayADTImpl.java

#### Linear search:
https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/2_array/LinearSearch.java

#### Binary search:
https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/2_array/BinarySearch.java

## Linked List:

### Introduction to Linked List:
- A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes that are linked together using pointers
- Each node contains two parts:
    - Data - actual data element
    - Pointer/Link - a reference to the next node in the sequence

### Types of Linked list:
- Singly 
    - Each node has a single pointer pointing to the next node. The last node point to NULL
    - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/tree/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/3_linked_list/singly
- Doubly 
    - Each node has two pointers: one points to the next node and the other points to the previous node
    - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/tree/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/3_linked_list/doubly
- Circular 
    - The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop
- Doubly circular 
    - A doubly linked list where the last node's pointer points to the first node, and the first node's previous pointer points to the last node

### Key operations:
- Insertion:
    - At the beginning - Insert a new node at the start
    - At the end - Insert a new node at the end
    - At a specific position - Insert a new node at the given position
- Deletion:
    - From the beginning - Remove the first node
    - From the end - Remove the last node
    - From a specific position - Remove a node from the given position
- Traversal: Moving through each node to display or process data
- Searching: Finding a node with a specific value

### Advantages:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion

### Disadvantages:
- Memory overhead: Each nodes requires additional memory for the pointers 
- Sequential access: Nodes must be accessed sequentially, making indexing ineffient compared to arrays
- Extra complexity: Managing pointers requires careful attention to avoid issues like memory leaks

### Circular Linked List:
In a circular doubly linked list, each node has two pointers ( next and prev ), just
like in a regular doubly linked list, but the difference is that:
1. The next pointer of the last node points to the head node.
2. The prev pointer of the head node points to the last node.
This creates a circular structure, allowing traversal from any node in a continuous
loop in either direction.

#### Key Concepts of Circular Doubly Linked List:
1. Circular Structure: The next of the last node points back to the head, and the
prev of the head points to the last node.
2. Traversal in Both Directions: Nodes can be traversed in both forward and
backward directions continuously.
3. Efficient for Cyclic Data Processing: Useful in applications that require
wrapping around, like task scheduling.

#### Circular Doubly Linked List Implementation in Java
- https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/3_linked_list/circular/CircularLinkedList.java

#### Key Operations:
- Insertion at the beginning and end: Adjusts head and tail pointers and sets
up circular links.
- Deletion from the beginning and end: Updates head , tail , and adjusts the
circular references.
- Display Forward/Backward: Traverse until reaching the starting node again.

#### Important Interview Questions on Circular Doubly Linked Lists
1. What are the differences between circular singly, doubly, and non-circular
linked lists?
2. How would you detect if a linked list is circular (circular singly or doubly)?
3. When would you use a circular doubly linked list over other linked list types?
4. How can you implement a circular linked list in a real-world application, like
a playlist or a round-robin scheduler?
5. How would you find the middle element in a circular linked list?
6. Can you implement a queue using a circular doubly linked list? How?

## Stack:

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first to be removed.
Imagine a stack of plates: the last plate you place on top is the first one you take
off.

#### Key Points about Stack
1. LIFO Principle: Last In, First Out.
2. Basic Operations:
    - Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
    - Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
    - isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
3. Applications:
    - Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
    - Backtracking algorithms (like maze solving).
    - Undo operations in applications.
    - Function call management in recursion.
4. Example of a Stack
    Imagine you’re reading through books:
    1. You put Book 1 on the table, followed by Book 2, then Book 3.
    2. Now, to read, you start with Book 3 (the last one placed).
    3. You remove Book 3 (pop), then read Book 2, and finally Book 1.

#### Implementation of Stack in Java
- Java has a built-in Stack class in java.util package, but we can also implement it
manually using an array or linked list.
- Using Array - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/4_stack/Stack.java
- Using LinkedList - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/4_stack/StackLinkedList.java

#### Interview Questions
1. Explain the LIFO principle with a real-life example.
- The LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle means that the last element added to a stack is the first one to be removed. A real-life example of LIFO is a stack of plates. When you add plates to the stack, each new plate goes on top. To take a plate, you start from the top, removing the last plate you added first.

2. Describe the differences between a stack and a queue.
- Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed.
- Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed.
- Common uses:
    - Stack: Used in backtracking, function call management, and expression evaluation.
    - Queue: Used in scheduling processes, handling requests in order, and breadth-first search in graphs.

3. Explain the function of the call stack in recursion.
- In recursion, each function call is placed on the call stack. The call stack helps to:
    1. Store the state of each function call, including variables and the point to
    return after the call completes.
    2. Track the order of calls in a LIFO manner, so each function call is executed and returned in the reverse order of how they were called.
- For example, in calculating a factorial, each call (e.g., factorial(3) ) depends on a
previous call (e.g., factorial(2) ). The call stack stores these until it reaches the
base case and then unwinds to return results in the reverse order.

## Queue:
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO)
principle, meaning the element added first will be removed first. It is similar to a
real-life queue (e.g., a line at a ticket counter).

#### Key Operations:
1. Enqueue: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Removing an element from the front of the queue.
3. Peek/Front: Getting the front element without removing it.
4. IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.
5. IsFull: (For fixed-size queues) Checking if the queue is full.

#### Types of Queues:
Queues come in different variations based on their structure and behavior. Below
are the main types of queues with their descriptions and examples:
1. Simple Queue (Linear Queue):
- Definition: A basic queue that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- Key Operations:
    - Enqueue: Add an element at the rear.
    - Dequeue: Remove an element from the front.
- Limitation: Once the queue is full, no more elements can be added even if some are removed (unless implemented as circular).
- Use Case: Customer service ticketing system.
- Example in Java:

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(10); // Enqueue
        queue.add(20);
        System.out.println(queue.poll()); // Dequeue: 10

2. Circular Queue:
- Definition: A queue where the rear pointer wraps around to the front when the end of the array is reached, making better use of storage.
- Key Difference: Unlike a simple queue, it efficiently utilizes the array by
reusing freed spaces.
- Use Case: CPU scheduling, memory management.
- Illustration:
    - Enqueue: Rear → Index wraps back to 0
    - Dequeue: Front → Index wraps back to 0
- Example in Java:
    - https://github.com/SushantPoman/Study/blob/main/DSA%20Durgesh/Codes/5_queue/CircularQueue.java

3. Priority Queue:
- Definition: A queue where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority, regardless of their order of arrival.
- Behavior:
    - Highest Priority: Removed first.
    - Same Priority: Follow FIFO for elements of equal priority.
- Use Case: Task scheduling, network packet management.
- Example in java:

        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.add(15); // Priority 1
        pq.add(10); // Priority 2
        pq.add(20); // Priority 0 (smallest value gets highest priori
        ty)
        System.out.println(pq.poll()); // Output: 10

4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue):
- Definition: A queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends
(front and rear).
- Variants: 
    - Input-restricted deque: Insertion allowed at one end, deletion allowed at both ends.
    - Output-restricted deque: Deletion allowed at one end, insertion allowed at both ends.
- Use Case: Palindrome checking, caching mechanisms (e.g., LRU Cache).

        import java.util.ArrayDeque;
        ArrayDeque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.addFirst(10); // Add at front
        deque.addLast(20); // Add at rear
        System.out.println(deque.removeFirst()); // Remove from front
        System.out.println(deque.removeLast()); // Remove from rear
    
5. Double Priority Queue:
- Definition: A priority queue that allows removal of both the highest and lowest-priority elements.
- Behavior: Removal happens based on either maximum or minimum priority.
- Use Case: Complex scheduling systems.

6. Concurrent Queue:
- Definition: A thread-safe queue designed for use in multi-threaded
environments.
- Types in Java:
    - ConcurrentLinkedQueue : Non-blocking queue.
    - BlockingQueue : Blocks when trying to enqueue/dequeue in full/empty conditions.
- Use Case: Producer-consumer problems in multithreading.

        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;
        ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Integer> cq = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
        cq.add(10);
        cq.add(20);
        System.out.println(cq.poll()); // Output: 10
    
7. Double-Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ):
- Definition: A combination of deque and priority queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends with priority considerations.
- Use Case: Advanced data management systems.

##### Dequeue:
- A deque (short for "double-ended queue") is a data structure where elements can be added or removed from both ends. It can operate as both a stack and a queue.
- Key Operations in a Deque:
    1. Add at the Front: addFirst()
    2. Add at the Rear: addLast()
    3. Remove from the Front: removeFirst()
    4. Remove from the Rear: removeLast()
    5. Peek Front Element: peekFirst()
    6. Peek Rear Element: peekLast()
    7. Check if Empty: isEmpty()
